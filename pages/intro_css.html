        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
        language intended to simplify the process of making web pages
        presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More
        importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that
        makes up each web page. CSS is easy to learn and understood but it
        provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. A
        CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and
        then applied to the corresponding elements in your document. A style
        rule set consists of a selector and declaration block. CSS is created
        and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS
        Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called
        specifications. When a specification has been discussed and officially
        ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation. These ratified
        specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control
        over the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies
        and organizations create that software.
